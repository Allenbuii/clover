## Project description

### Project idea

We will build a product which has a drone and an autonomous car for spying or delivering things.

### The potential outcomes

We have already finished the robot car and be able to build the map for autonomous moving with ROS Navigation, SLAM.

We will try to build some features that make a communication between the robot car and Clover Drone. The Clover will observe robot car path, if there is any obstacle on the way of robot, Clover will inform to robot car to re-create a new path.

### Using Clover platform

The Clover will detect the target and send navigation goal to car robot in the ground where we already knew the map. For the unseen map, we will use robot to control Clover to discover if the car robot can move to that terrain or not.
